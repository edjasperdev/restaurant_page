A client has asked us to make a new landing page for them. They want the same design as the one in assets/pagedesign.jpg
---
Some things to note:
- Please use your own branch and submit a pull request to merge to master.
- Please use flexbox for creating the top nav.
- The nav items should have some type of hover effect but dont need to go anywhere on click. How would we stub these links?
- The logos they want to use are black but it would be best if they were white, how can we fix this?
